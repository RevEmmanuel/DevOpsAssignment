EQUIPMENT

Figure it out for yourself, my lad,
You're all that the greatest of men have had,
Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes,
And a brain to use if you would be wise.
With this equipment we all began,
So start for the top and say 'I can.'

Look them over, the wise and great,
They take their food from a common plate,
And similar knives and forks they use,
With similar laces they tie their shoes,
The world considers the brave and smart,
But you've all they have when they made their start.

You are triumph and come to skill,
You can be great if you only will.
You're well equipped for what path you choose,
You have arms and legs and a brain to use,
And the Man who has risen great deeds to do
Began his life with no more than you.

You are the handicap you must face,
You are the one who must choose your place,
You must say where you want to go,
How much you will study the truth to know.
God has equipped you for life, but He
Let's you decide what you want to be.

Courage must come from the soul within,
The man must furnish the will to win.
So figure it out for yourself, my lad.
You were born with all that the greatest have had,
With your equipment they all began
Get a hold of yourself and say: 'I Can.'
